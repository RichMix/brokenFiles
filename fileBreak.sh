# If no access to mac OS terminal or Linux the Strings Recipe in Cyber Chef will output first clue towards finding flag

# From 2024 Fall NCL Gymnasium
# To determine the original file type from the provided binary data (magic bytes), follow these steps:

# CyberChef: Paste the binary data into CyberChef and search for magic bytes or file header patterns to confirm the file type.
# Hex Editor: Load the binary data into a hex editor and inspect the first few bytes. The sequence FF D8 FF E0 confirms it is a JPEG file.
cat flag.jpeg

# Open the Image: Open the flag.jpeg file in an image viewer to check if it contains visible information or text.
# Check for Embedded Metadata: Use exiftool to analyze any hidden metadata in the image, which could contain a clue or the flag:
exiftool flag.jpeg

binwalk (search for embedded files or data):

binwalk -e flag.jpeg

# Repair the JPEG File: Attempt to repair the corrupted file with tools like JPEGsnoop or online JPEG repair services:
# JPEGsnoop: Analyze the JPEG for structural issues and attempt fixes.
# Online Repair Tools: Use tools like Online Image Editor for quick checks and minor fixes.
# Advanced Analysis with foremost or scalpel: Use file carving tools to recover embedded data or files:

foremost -i flag.jpeg -o output_directory
scalpel flag.jpeg -o output_directory

# Explanation: JPEG Format Error: This often means the structure of the JPEG is corrupted, potentially masking hidden data.
# binwalk and steghide can help uncover hidden payloads or data if they are embedded within the image.
# Try these steps, and let me know if you uncover additional details or need further help!

The output appears to show sections of ASCII strings extracted from the flag.jpeg file. This includes references to common JPEG and PNG file structures (e.g., JFIF, IHDR, IDAT, IEND). Additionally, there are mentions of GIMP (Created with GIMPW), which is software that might have been used to modify or create this image. Here are further steps and observations:

Key Observations:
File Structures Detected:

# JPEG Markers (JFIF): Indicates a standard JPEG file format.
# PNG Markers (IHDR, IDAT, IEND): Suggests there may be embedded PNG data within the JPEG, or the file could have been modified to include sections of PNG content.
binwalk -e flag.jpeg
foremost -i flag.jpeg -o output_directory

# The last highlighted byte is 0d, but should be 01 to match the magic bytes for a jpeg file
# Based on the prompt, we know that this file has been tampered with in some way. Running the strings recipe in cyberchef can help reveal some clues to determine what has happened - perhaps some of the unchanged portion of the file will point to the original file type. 

Even after correcting the magic bytes and changing the file extension to .png, the file fails to open using an image viewer. Since the png file signature is 8-bytes long and the jpeg file signature is 12 bytes long, it is possible that the extra 4 bytes that remain from the jpeg file signature are causing errors when using an image viewer. To correct this, we can attempt to copy the 4 bytes following the png file signature from a known valid png file and see if that will correct the problem. 

# The 4 bytes following the file signature in our valid sample png file are 
# The 4 bytes following the file signature in our valid sample png file are 00 00 00 0D 
# Replacing the 4 bytes (
# Replacing the 4 bytes (49 46 00 0D) that follow the png file signature with 00 00 00 0D
# After making this final modification, the file will successfully open. 

Questions
What is the original file type? (PNG)

What is the flag? 
# OPEN FILE IN HEXED.IT

Replace the first 12 bytes with the standard PNG signature and padding bytes:
plaintext
Copy code
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D

Explanation:
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A is the PNG signature.
00 00 00 0D are padding bytes required after the PNG signature to ensure proper formatting.
Save the Changes: Save the modified file.

# Rename the File Extension: Rename the file from .jpeg to .png:
mv flag.jpeg flag.png
Open the File in an Image Viewer: Open flag.png in an image viewer to see if it displays properly. The file should now open as a PNG, and the flag should be visible within the image.
